<h3 style="text-align: center"> Hi! My name is Madeline Perry. </h3>
<h4 style="text-align: right"> I am from Union, KY. I'm a senior here at the Univeristy of Kentucky, and I recently turned 21 <bold> (woot,woot!). </bold>
I will graduate in May with a Bachelor's degree in Integrated Strategic Communication.
With this degree, I am pursuing a career as a PR director. </h4>
<body style="text-align: right"> Currently, I am a waitress at a local BBQ restaurant, between work and school- I'm a pretty busy person.
  However, I enjoy going to basketball and football games, being with friends and family, and online shopping too! <body/>

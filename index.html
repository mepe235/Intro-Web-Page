<h4 style="text-align: right"> I am from Union, KY. I'm a senior here at the Univeristy of Kentucky, and I recently turned 21 (woot,woot!).
I will graduate in May with a Bachelor's degree in Integrated Strategic Communication. With this degree, I am pursuing a career as a PR director. </h4>
<body style="text-align: right"> Currently, I am a waitress at a local BBQ restaurant, between work and school- I'm a pretty busy person.
  However; I enjoy going to basketball and football games, being with friends and family, writing, and online shopping too! <body/>

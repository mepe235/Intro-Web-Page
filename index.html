<h4 style="text-align: center"> I am from Union, KY. I'm a senior here at the Univeristy of Kentucky, and I recently turned 21 (woot,woot!).
When I was a kid, I REALLY wanted to be Hannah Montana (hence my image for my page), but since then things have changed a bit. In May, I will graduate with a Bachelor's degree in <bold> Integrated Strategic Communication. </bold> With this degree, I am pursuing a career as a PR director.
Currently, I am a waitress at a local BBQ restaurant, between work and school- I'm a pretty busy person.
However; I enjoy going to basketball and football games, being with friends and family, writing, and online shopping too! </h4>
